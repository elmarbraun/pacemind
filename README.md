# PaceMind Website

This repository contains the static files for the PaceMind landing page. The site provides information about the project in several languages and includes a contact form.

## Local development

No build steps are required. Simply serve the files with any static web server or open `index.html` in a browser. To enable service worker features locally, you should serve the site over HTTP using a tool like `npx serve` or `python3 -m http.server`.

## Contact

For questions please contact the maintainers via the form on [pacemind.io](https://pacemind.io).
